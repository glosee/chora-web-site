  <h1>어렵지 않아. 너는 할 수 있다.</h1>
  <p>HTML <u>(HyperText Markup Language)</u> is a standard developed over the years to convey information<br> 
  over the internet by using <strong>"hyperlinks"</strong> - or just links as we know them today.<br>
  As opposed to a PDF, an HTML page is much more dynamic in nature,<br>  
  letting you browse the web by clicking on links and interacting with the page.<br> 
  Links could take you either to a different location within the current page, <br>
  or to a different page over the internet.</p>
